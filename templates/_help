		@fullname color scheme

@fullname is a popular colorscheme originally designed by morhetz. The Vim
version comes in three variants:

- @shortname: "medium" contrast;
- @shortname_hard: "hard" contrast;
- @shortname_soft: "soft" contrast.

Each variant supports dark and light backgrounds, so you must set 'background'
before loading the colorscheme. For example:
>
	set background=dark
	colorscheme @shortname
<
@fullname works out of the box anywhere, from black&white terminals to
true-color terminals and GUI versions of Vim.

@fullname is distributed under the terms of the MIT license.

Colorscheme options				*@prefix-options*

						*g:@prefix_bold*
Set to 0 to suppress boldface in gVim.
>
	let g:@prefix_bold = 1
<
NOTE: to disable boldface in terminal Vim, use your terminal's preferences, or
try putting the following line in your |vimrc|:
>
	set t_md=
<
						*g:@prefix_filetype_hi_groups*
Set to 1 to include syntax highlighting definitions for several filetypes.
>
	let g:@prefix_filetype_hi_groups = 0
<
Note: in older versions of Vim, setting this to 1 may leave "a wake of
destruction when switching away" (Tim Pope), that is, when you switch to
a different colorscheme the highlighting may look wrong or disabled.

						*g:@prefix_italic*
						*g:@prefix_italics*
Set to 0 if you do not want to enable italics. Note that the color scheme in
normal circumstances automatically detects whether italics is available. You
should never need to set this option explicitly. You may want to unset it if
you do not want Vim to display italics even when the feature is available
(e.g., in GUI versions of Vim).
>
	let g:@prefix_italics = 1
<
						*g:@prefix_italicize_strings*
Set to 0 if you do not want strings in italics.
>
	let g:@prefix_italicize_strings = 1
<
						*g:@prefix_plugin_hi_groups*
Set to 1 to include syntax highlighting definitions for a number of popular
plugins:
>
	let g:@prefix_plugin_hi_groups = 0
<
Note: in older versions of Vim, setting this to 1 may leave "a wake of
destruction when switching away" (Tim Pope), that is, when you switch to
a different colorscheme the highlighting may look wrong or disabled.

						*g:@prefix_transp_bg*
Set to 1 if you want a transparent background. Takes effect only in the
terminal.
